I will be uploading brief summaries of various math subjects here. \\
These summaries are designed to provide a quick review, including concise theoretical explanations and straightforward practice problems to reinforce the concepts.
I've also included references for readers who wish to delve deeper into the topics.
If you find any mistakes in the summaries, please let me know. I studied the math degree in Spanish so I apologize in advance if you find any unusual English.

Thank you in advance,

David
